# Personalized Discovery and Engagement Enhancement System

## Project Overview
The **Personalized Discovery and Engagement Enhancement System** is designed for Meesho to improve user engagement and product discovery through personalized recommendations and insightful analytics. This project leverages user interaction data, search behavior, and notification efficacy to create a more tailored shopping experience.

## Objectives
1. **Enhance User Engagement**: By analyzing user interactions, we aim to provide personalized content that resonates with user preferences.
2. **Optimize Product Discovery**: Implementing trending product features and recommendations based on user behavior to facilitate easier product discovery.
3. **Measure User Interaction**: Evaluate user engagement through key performance indicators (KPIs) to inform future strategies.
4. **Assess Search Behavior**: Analyze search methods to identify trends in voice vs. text searches, aiming to improve search functionality.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Voice Search Adoption Rate**: This KPI measures the percentage of searches performed using voice recognition compared to total searches over the past 24 hours. It helps identify user preferences and potential enhancements in the search functionality.
   
2. **Trending Products**: By tracking view counts for products, we can identify which products are currently popular among users. This insight assists in product placement and marketing strategies.

3. **User Engagement Metrics**: Measuring the total interactions per user over a specified period allows us to identify the most engaged users, helping to focus marketing efforts and improve user retention.

4. **Search Trends**: Comparing voice and text search interactions over time provides insights into user preferences and helps inform future search feature developments.
